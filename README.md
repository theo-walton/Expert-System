all uppercase letters are variables.

a fact consists of varaibles and logical operators. Eg `B + !C => (A | X) & C`

a query is a ? followed by the variables you want to query. For example `?ABC` asks what the value of A, B and C is

an `=` sign can be followed by a list of variables to quickly say what variables are true. For example `=ACB` means A, B and C are true.

logical operators inclue:
`!, |, &, =>, <=>`
and the statement can be bracketed
